              <h2>ANNUAL FLAGSHIP MACHINE LEARNING HACKATHON</h2>
              <br>
              <b>BANYAN << HACK >> 2016 </b><p id="mainText"> is the annual flagship Machine Learning hackathon for college students. It's organized by Venturesity! 
              <br>
              <br>
              The idea is to help college students get their feet wet into Machine Learning topics.
              <br>
              <br>
              As you are aware, humanity generates huge amounts of data. A total of 2.5 Quintillion bytes per day! If our math's correct, that works out to about 30 terabytes every second give or take! That’s huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!!!!!!!!!!!
              <br>
              <br>
               But how do you aim to make sense of all this data? One way is machine learning. And that’s where you come in. It doesn’t matter if you have no experience in this domain. After all, some of the best discoveries are done by noobs!
               <br>
               <br>
              For about 86400 seconds (that's 24 hours for you) of hacking, we invite college students all throughout India to come and hack at Banyon Hacks! Give wings to your deep-rooted ideas and show them off to the world! </p>

              <br>
